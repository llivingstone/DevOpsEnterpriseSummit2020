##### Introduction

Nationwide is in the midst of an organisation-wide pivot, realigning from a largely functional organisation to one fully aligned to our ‘Member’ needs.  We’re calling these our ‘Missions’.  

You heard from Nationwide last year and how we have focussed on digital transformation.  This year hear how this wider organisational change is happening, all underpinned by much stronger Agile and DevOps practices, and Ways of Working cultural shift.  

Patrick Eltridge (Chief Operating Officer) and Janet Chapman (Mission Leader) will bring this transformation to life including the industry imperatives for this change and how we are progressing.  

We also want to hear from talented individuals who share Nationwide’s values and ambitions, and who bring the skills and capabilities required to make this transition happen!
