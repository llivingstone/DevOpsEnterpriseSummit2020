##### Introduction

SRE is a large, complex topic, so we’ll start with common terminology and theory, then dive into practical examples—including lessons learned from our own journey here at Datadog. We’ll further cover the relationship between SRE and DevOps, what success looks like (and how to measure it), and how to identify and nurture both internal and external talent in order to build a cross-functional team.

##### Notes

* Clear up confusion about DevOps and SRE
  
  * DevOps is a professional movemenent that seeks to improve the QoL of engineers and customers as a whole
  
  * CAMS (Culture, Automation, Measurement and Sharing)
  
  * Big lizard in the room: Important to note the SRE handbook for Google is one interpritation of SRE, and doesn't fit all companies.

* Team and organisational structure
  
  * Datadog structure has product teams, squads and guilds
    
    * Squads are short term teams used to fix one issue, or a single OKR. Very focused, not like a team where the scope is huge
    
    * Guilds are smaller teams that are semi-perm, they own important company wide projects and own them and create standards (Golang, Automation, Coding standards) come to mind. Can be a mix of people across teams
  
  * SRE teams are very versatile
    
    - Code reviews, incident reports, post-mortems
    
    - Support a portfolio (Service ownership inside Platform team) or a product team
    
    - Individual SREs may rotate in and out of project and sprints

* Tips of finding and growing SRE talent
  
  * SREs are people, and people have personalities (Some people are happier doing some things than others) Examples:
    
    * Patience for staring at code
    
    * Enjoy problem-solving
    
    * Communication
    
    * Mentoring / Teaching
    
    * Wide range of technical interests
  
  * SREs have backgrounds, some DD examples
    
    * Traditional Ops or Dev profiles
    
    * PhD in Computer science (At DD)
    
    * **Great SRE talent can come from anywhere**

* Practical suggestions and pitfalls
  
  * Structure of SRE teams (Standalone, Embedded etc) depends on the organisation. Needs to be tested to see what works.

##### Takeaways

* Squad idea is nice. Gave an example of squads to create Coding tests, or arrange hackithons. Small teams centred around a single problem and normally timeboxed.

* Guilds might become useful for standards in the future.
