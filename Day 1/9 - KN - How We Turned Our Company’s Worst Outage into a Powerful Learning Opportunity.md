##### Introduction

n February 2019, we experienced the worst outage in company history. This outage was the result of a complex system failure that pushed us beyond the limits of our current response systems, processes and culture. In the face of this adversity, we were able to find opportunity in failure. This resulted in improving how we understand incidents, respond to them, and prevent them in the first place. Now, we have a stronger organizational ability to perform incident management, we’ve reinforced and broadened culture norms around safety, and most impactfully, we have implemented an incident management system that has changed how we run outage calls. Despite how it can feel at the time, failure does not have to be permanently catastrophic. It’s how you respond to that failure that will ultimately shape your organization. Learn how you can apply what we’ve learned to make the most of outages and drive improvement within your organization.
