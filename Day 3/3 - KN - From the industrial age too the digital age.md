##### Introduction

Our session tells the story of how we inherited a stalling, debt burdened project, relying on external suppliers, and under mounting pressure to deliver urgently, and used it as the catalyst to create a new, permanent digital capability. This can pivot and meet the needs of the challenging times we live in, delivering new products that are digitising the way Coats engage with our customers   

We will describe how we filled the product gap, how we created a ‘dev circle of life’ to enable rapid development and operational excellence, and share some lessons learned along the way. We will also dip into examples from our past transformation journeys and highlight some patterns we have seen, and then attempt the impossible, and show to the world for the first time, a scientific formula for successful digital transformation. Or as we call it ‘The Success Calculus’.
