##### Introduction

This isn't a talk about...  

- how we've got it nailed at Virgin Atlantic
- Puppet or Jenkins or Azure DevOps or Teams vs Slack or how we only use perfectly-chiseled T-shaped SREs or The Golden Framework etc. etc.
- the right way to "do it"

This is a talk about...  

- what to do when you've been told to fix the un-fixable
- what to do when you don't know where to start
- what to do when what you're doing doesn't seem to be working

##### Notes

* What was the problem?
  
  * Heavy silo'd   
  
  * Loads of technology (Possibly to much!)
  
  * Business didn't trust tech
  
  * Leadership pushing top down

* Old ways of Working
  
  * Waterfall
  
  * High cost, long running project
  
  * High cost contractors and no documentation
  
  * Loads of suppliers testing code

* What might help fix the problem?
  
  * Agility
  
  * Speed
  
  * DevOps isnt just CI/CD

* What did we have to work with?
  
  * Great partners (Airfrance, KLM)
  
  * Delta also agile and used/spoke to them
  
  * Suppliers v Delivery Partners
  
  * Repurpose training budget (Reuse the training rooms used to train crew)

* Where were the opportunities?
  
  * (With No monye, no mandate and no top-down by in)
  
  * One agile project already running
  
  * Then they grew out to
    
    * Data
    
    * API
    
    * SVC (Single customer view)
    
    * Mobility
  
  * Ran loads of workshops to find what they did well and didn't

* Driving progress though ownership
  
  * Tackling bottlenecks
  
  * Teams drive their own values
  
  * High trust, low blame teams
  
  * People engagement
    
    * Workshops etc
    
    * Got security on board
    
    * Build communities inside the workspace

* Problems....
  
  * Taking to long to do DevOps (It's not fast enough) from managment/leadership
  
  * No buy in from other teams due to their workload
  
  * Cost - More infrastructure
  
  * Weeks to onboard staff due to security measures (old school - week to get access to building)
  
  * Staff got poached

* Progress
  
  * Core Platform Team established
  
  * Consolidated from Jira/Confluence to Azure DevOps
  
  * Pushed champions inside teams

* Changes in Leadership
  
  * Multiple changes leadership across four years (Multiple reorg)
  
  * New CIO has an agile mindset and growth which the team was already working on

* Next steps
  
  * Learned how to get the basics right
  
  * We wanted capabilities not silos
  
  * Critical mindset change at org level

* New Ways of Working
  
  * Established core value streams (owned by execs)
  
  * Everything got scored on Why
  
  * Visability across all streams + risk + cost etc
  
  * Sync'd everything to quarterly planning cycle

* Summary
  
  * New way of working
  
  * Value streams -> Programs -> Delivery Teams -> Features
  
  * Use Kamban for most, some still waterfall

##### Takeaways

* How they pushed a DevOps mindset in the org without any buy in

* How they created standards and scores to provide visbability to everyone in leadership
