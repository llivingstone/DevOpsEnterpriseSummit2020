##### Introduction

Maersk is in the middle of an overall digital transformation that has a huge impact on how the enterprise views value and brings it to market. As part of this transformation, we have realized that the biggest constraint in getting value to market faster is our own organization. We are changing that with DevOps.  

Join us for a talk about how you can leverage LEAN practices and DevOps practices to accelerate the creation of new innovative digital solutions to create new business value streams.
