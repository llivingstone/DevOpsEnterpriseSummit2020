##### Introduction

Betway has been following a “test in production” approach to building software for a few years. They test in production for two primary reasons: to validate business hypotheses and gain confidence in technical implementations. In this session, Michael will share tips, experiences, and lessons learned from testing in production.Some of the topics will include:   
• A/B testing: how Betway implements A/B tests and gathers data to prove that a product change is adding value  
• Trunk-based development: how Betway uses this technique to release incomplete and broken code into production, so it can to be continually tested and refined within the production environment  
• Managing problems: how Betway resolves both technical and business problems that arise. Michael will also share how the company implemented key aspects of testing in production across several systems. Plus, he’ll share a framework they adopted to streamline the whole process.
