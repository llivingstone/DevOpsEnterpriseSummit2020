##### Introduction

An anthropologist would describe *The Unicorn Project* as a way to transform a high-context environment into a low-context environment. In this talk Tom describes how Stack Overflow uses this anthropological concept to make our DevOps environment more effective. Techniques include: smart defaults, “make the right way, the lazy way”, and documentation at the right time and place.  

A high-context DevOps culture is one where most knowledge is unspoken, or people depend on history/experience rather than explicit telling. This can be very frustrating for new employees. A low-context DevOps culture is one where the info you need to do your job is available, visible, and accessible. Creating a low-context culture improves new-hire onboarding, enables project hopping, and helps you handle a page you receive at 2am. Because engineers tend to hop projects within a company, we're constantly becoming "the new person".

##### Notes

* High and low context cultures
  
  * Example: First week at SO asked how to create a VM. No docs etc. "How would i of known that without help?" 
    Otherside of the story "How does anyone NOT know that?"
  
  * High Context Cultures
    
    * Communications is implict. Less formal info
    
    * People have to read between the lines to understand what's going on
  
  * Low context cultures
    
    * Rules
    
    * communication is explicit
    
    * Knowledge tends to be codified, public, external and accessible
    
    * more interpersonal connections
    
    * Knowledge is transferable

* Low context Devops
  
  * Should strive to be low context
  
  * Lower the context of your environment
    
    * Carefully constructed defaults
    
    * Mentions the unicorn project book.
  
  * Documentation when you need them
    
    * Error messages
    
    * CI/CD
    
    * Alert messages
  
  * Culture of Documentation
    
    * Management sets expectations
    
    * File bugs about docs just like software
    
    * Culture of always updating as you work (ALWAYS BE DOCUMENTING)
    
    * Fight the "my code is the documentation" saying
    
    * Documentation = relax while you're on holiday or not stuck on one project
    
    * Why people avoid writing docs
      
      * Uncertian scope
        
        * How far do you want me to go?
      
      * Uncertian audience
      
      * Blank Screen (No words on the page)
        
        * Fix: Templates (Service document + Alert Doc)

* Leadership
  
  * Who makes it happen?
    
    * You.
  
  * Leadership is about going first, not being a manager or Lead.

* Summary
  
  * Devops environments should be low context
  
  * Smart defaults
  
  * Make right easy
