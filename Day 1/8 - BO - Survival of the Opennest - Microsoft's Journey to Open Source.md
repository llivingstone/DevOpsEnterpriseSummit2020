##### Introduction

In this session you will learn how Microsoft went from an inward focused culture towards open source and then how collaborating in the open is now helping them to collaborate better inside the company.  

When Martin Woodward joined Microsoft ten years ago, open source was called “a cancer”. A decade later, the world has changed. Now, 90% of the code we use comes from open source, GitHub has become the largest developer community on the planet, and Microsoft is one of the largest contributors to open source.  
It doesn’t matter if you are a hobbyist, a start-up, a bank, whether you are flying rockets to other planets, building a personal website, or even taking pictures of a black hole - open source is now vital to how you collaborate and build software.  

Sasha Rosenbaum will dig deep into Microsoft’s open source evolution, and give you the insider’s view on witnessing the company pivot to understanding and accepting the new mindset. Sasha and Martin will share how even the unlikeliest companies can learn to use and contribute to open source, and how to apply the culture of openness and collaboration “inside the corporate firewall” to empower your organization to achieve more.

##### Notes

* Consume Responsibly
  
  * Open source maintainers don't owe you anything
  
  * 99% of organizations make use of opensource, even if they don't realise it
  
  * Breaches cost money - Dectecting this in the supply chain (During development) or Code scanning etc prevents this before the code is shipped

* Understand the business need to contribute
  
  * Forking is integration debt
  
  * Pushing fixes upstream helps everyone else
  
  * Opensource communities value code over everything else
  
  * Be welcoming when people suggest changes, or create issues and PR/MRs
