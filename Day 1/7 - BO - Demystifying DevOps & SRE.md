SRE is a large, complex topic, so we’ll start with common terminology and theory, then dive into practical examples—including lessons learned from our own journey here at Datadog. We’ll further cover the relationship between SRE and DevOps, what success looks like (and how to measure it), and how to identify and nurture both internal and external talent in order to build a cross-functional team.
